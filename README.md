## Description
- This project includes a backend JavaScript employee tracker program. You're given multiple options to manage your employees. You're able to add, delete, and update various options including; roles, employees, and departments.
- My motivation for working and creating this project was to further understand databases and managing backend programs with inquirer and queries.

## Usage 
- You're given access to a command prompt once you run (node server.js)
- Once you type in that input, the program runs... In which you're given access to various options regarding what you would like to do with your employees. Update, delete, and add new employees, departments, and roles.
